# React Native 'this' is undefined Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native functional components where `this.props` and `this.state` are undefined because the `this` keyword is not correctly bound within a functional component.

## The Problem

Functional components in React Native do not have a `this` context like class components. Attempting to access `this.props` or `this.state` within a functional component will result in a runtime error.

## The Solution

The solution is to use React Hooks such as `useState` for managing state and accessing props directly through the props parameter of the functional component.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug` directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` (depending on your platform).
4. Observe the error message in the console.

## How to fix

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `bugSolution` directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` (depending on your platform).
4. The app will run correctly without any errors.
